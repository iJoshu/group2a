About Us

	We are a group of scholars from St. Louis University, 
trying to make a difference by spreading awareness on three (3) 
chosen topics and/or issues: Good Governance, Cultural Heritage 
Promotion and Preservation, and Animal Welfare. We are tasked to 
create advocacies to be implemented in our chosen Barangay. 
Our audience comprised of the surroundings of Legarda-Burnham-Kisad area.
	
	We promote the preservations and protection of cultural 
heritage that has been passed down for generations. We also address 
the issues and problems on governance and on how to improve them. We 
are also advocates of animal welfare that promotes the humane way of 
treating animals.
	
	We are the next generation of individuals that will inherit 
Baguio City.
